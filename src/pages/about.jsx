                    Hi! I'm Paul.
            </p>
                <p>
                    A software engineer specializing in full-stack web development. <br />
                    Currently, I'm working in Sydney, AU as a Consultant.
            </p>
                <p>
                    â€”
            </p>
                <p>
                    As software engineers do, I enjoy programming. <br />
                    It gets you engaged, you solve problems, you can see Hagrid calling you a wizard in the corner of your eye as you type. It's fun. <br />
                    However, technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. It exists in the real world where it has to solve real problems. <br />
                    And when you're talking about technology to a peer, technical or not, you'll often run into either of two problems.
            </p>
                <p>
                    - As you explain, you realise they don't understand anything you're saying. <br />
                    - As you explain, you realise you don't understand anything you're saying.
            </p>
                <p>
                    Nobody is to blame here. Technology is a sandcastle built atop another sandcastle on a mountain - in outer space. <br />
                    Abstraction as a concept was created so that we wouldn't have to conquer every level of this nightmare clown castle just to get started. <br />
                    That being said, I like exploring this nightmare clown castle. <br />
                    So, on this blog I'd like to take you with me to explore this castle - to understand it better. <br />
                    Hopefully afterwards, we can explain things in a way where we don't confuse the other party and ourselves.
